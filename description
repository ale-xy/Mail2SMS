Short Description: App will read email inbox. When an email is received it evaluates based on who sent the email, and may send an SMS.

Full Description:

The app will check an email account waiting for emais. Must only consider email from a set domain. The first part of the email is our UserID and will be used to identify who sent the email.
When it receives the email, it checks a database file, find UserID's credentials, check if it is valid and if it is, sends a SMS message to numbers found on his credentials.

Database file must be easily editable(preferably .xls or .csv) and contain the following information for each client ( I attached an example of my database file is):

UserID;User Name;Contact number1;Contact number2;Contact Number3;Status(Valid or Expired);misc slot1;misc slot2;misc slot3.

The message sent by sms must contain what's inside "misc slot1"and "misc slot2" for the user and the current date and time.


All emails checked by the APP must be moved to a "checked" folder on the email.

I want to be able to check the mailbox our APP is checking.

UI can be very simple, A start/stop button is more than enough. Configuration of email settings can be done by reading a configuration file or on the app's UI whatever is easier for you to code.

The app must deal with all emails on the inbox when it starts.

I am open to suggestions if it makes you job much easier without harm to features.

Examples considering the use of attached sample database file:


Example 1:

It is 1/1/18, 10:00, App detects new email from 10001@mydomain .com.
Expected actions:
Status row for user 10001 is Ok.
It would send the message "Sample text 1 Sample Text 11 - 1/1/18, 10:00" to numbers 111111111, 111111112 and 111111113 and move the email to the checked folder.

Example 2:

It is 2/2/18, 12:00, App detects new email from 88125@mydomain .com.
Expected actions:
Status row for user 88125 is Ok.
It would send the message "Sample text 6 Sample Text 16 - 2/2/18, 12:00" to numbers 666666666 , 666666667 and 666666668 and move the email to the checked folder.

Example 3:

It is 1/2/18, 11:25, App detects new email from 88124@mydomain .com.
Expected Actions:
Status row for user 88124 is not OK, move the email to the checked folder without sending SMS.

Examlpe 4:

It is 1/1/18, 10:00, App detects new email from 10001@notmydomain .com.
Expected actions:
Email is not from @mydomain.com, does nothing and moves email to checked folder.
